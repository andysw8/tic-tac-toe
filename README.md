# Tic Tac Toe
This is my first project. My version of a classic - Tic-Tac-Toe in the jungle. 

## Getting started
Click on the link to play [https://andysw8.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://andysw8.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
- To begin the game, click 'Click to Play' 
- There are 2 players 'X' and 'O' 
- You will be prompted who's turn it is above the game square. 
- When it's your turn, simply click on any one of the 9 squares. 
- The aim of the game is to get 3 in a row of your selected player ('X' or 'O')
- If you either win or draw, you can play again when the 'play again' button appears. 

## Technologies 
I built my Tic-Tac-Toe game using the following: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Planning
I had a general idea of how I wanted the game to look and what functions I wanted to put in. I thought it was a good idea to start off by writing my plan on paper. This soon didn't really become integral to my plan, instead just a bit of scrap paper to jot down things every now and then.

## Challenges a long the way 
The biggest challenges during the whole process were MAINLY two things: 
 - Working out how to alternate between 'O' and 'X' (or 'Naughts' and 'Crosses' when I first started)
 - Wrapping my head around the 'win' logic

I faced a few other small bumps in the road, but these two things were what consumed most of my time. I tend to overthink things and go down a complicated path, in hindsight this has made me realise to always bring myself back to the start and keep it simple.  

## Things I  have learnt from my first project
Building this game from scratch has helped me conceptualise everything from the beginning. It's like telling a story and each function is a chapter. Keeping things simple and reading things in normal English to understand if things make sense is my biggest take away from this. I am progressively improving in this. 

## Future Improvements
 - Choose player mode (play against computer)
 - Scoreboard to track wins and draws
 - Sounds
 - CSS animations
